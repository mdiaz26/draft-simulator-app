## Fantasy Football

The object of the game is to populate your roster with players that you expect to perform best in the upcoming NFL season. The more yards, catches, and touchdowns they account for, the more points your team scores and the more likely you are to win the championship. In an auction, participants take turns nominating players that are then bid on by the entire league. Whoever is willing to bid most for the player has that player added to their roster and that amount subtracted from their remaining budget.
